Hi. My name is Alex Mesker. I'm a [Max Certified Trainer](https://cycling74.com/certified-trainers) who loves talking about Max.

I created **Max Tricks** as a place to throw searchable ideas, patcher snippets, and functionality reminders/deep-dives/explainers into a singular placeâ€¦ instead of having patchers littered across my hard drives. Others may find its content useful.

This is a living workspace, so expect URLs to change as things settle in.

If you have anything you'd like to ask about, you can contact me at **alex at x37v dot com**.
