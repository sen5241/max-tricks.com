Hi. My name is Alex Mesker. I'm a [Max Certified Trainer](https://cycling74.com/certified-trainers) who loves writing and talking about Max.





I created **Max Tricks** as a place to throw ideas, patcher snippets, and anything else ranging from reminders/explainers/deep-dives into a singular searchable placeâ€¦ instead of having patchers littered across my hard drives. Others may find its content useful.

I write in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and build/deploy with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). This is a living workspace, so expect URLs to change as things settle in.


If you have anything you'd like to chat about, you can find me on [Max Discord](https://discord.gg/pmStRfUr2k) or contact me directly at **alex at x37v dot com**.
