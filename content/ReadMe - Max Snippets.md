Here are some things to be aware of. The 'Table of Contents' on the right will not strip out tags, so you *can't* use the maxobj shortcut to stylise words in headings.

You can wrap the object names in backticks, but reserve the maxobj shortcut for in-text only.


The pattern for producing Max objects is: hashbang maxobj inlets outlets object-name.
eg. #!maxobj-3-2 patcher


Max objects can also be written as 
```max-object
tabs
```

```max-message
gabs
```

```burger
buns
```

`#!maxobj-0-0 trigger`


`#!maxobj-1-0 Uzi`

How about inline stuff like this `#!maxobj-4-3 loadbang` object here.

How about inline stuff like this `#!maxobj-10-3 loadbang` object here.

How about inline stuff like this `#!maxobj-3-2 loadbang` object here.


How about inline stuff like this `#!maxmessage 44100.` object here.

## What about stuff within a heading: `#!maxobj-1-1 button`

Looks good.
