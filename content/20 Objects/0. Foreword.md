Although I never got to meet Darwin, I consider him and Gregory Taylor my Max *teachers* — I didn't learn Max in any formal setting, but Darwin and Gregory wrote the first Max tutorials which I read and studied in my early days of learning Max. After working with Max for years, there are still gems to be found in these teaching materials.

Max is a journey of discovery, and seeing how Darwin and Gregory solved problems shaped *my* approach to problem-solving and my use of Max today more generally (organisationally/logically).
