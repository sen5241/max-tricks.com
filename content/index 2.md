Max Tricks is an online resource for learning [Cycling '74](https://cycling74.com)'s [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max).

Addition of material is ongoing so expect things to move around in the early stages.

Some deep-dives into building ideas in Max will be coming soon, but in the meantime, you can check out a reprint of Darwin Grosse's [[0. Introduction|20 Objects Curriculum]].
